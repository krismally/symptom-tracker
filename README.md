# Logr
A CRUD web application to track symptoms for people with chronic illnesses. Based off of my own analog symptom tracker!

## Logr's Story
I came up with the idea for Logr after I had created a Daily Symptom Log to better track and manage my Fibromyalgia. An issue many people with chronic illnesses have (including myself) is remembering all of the triggers, symptoms, and general chaos each day includes. This makes it harder to manage your symptoms and almost impossible to fully explain them to doctors. Logr is a solution to that!

Logr gives users the ability to track a variety of symptoms by filling out a Daily Log. The Daily Log is designed to be thorough while remaining easy to complete. Logr's UI/UX design prioritizes accessibility and responsiveness with large text and icons for readability, user-friendly form inputs, and a consistent, well-thought out structure.

## Planning
### Research
First, I posted in chronic illness forums and talked with my friends that also have chronic illnesses. I got feedback on features users would want and any other expectations. Then, I examined similar apps to identify any commonalities. My research stage also included learning more about creating accessible applications!

### User Stories
Before starting to code, I created user stories in a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/0pU2UzMl/logr-user-stories). These acted as a to-do list as I developed Logr.
